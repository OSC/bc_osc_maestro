      - **any** - (*1-28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
        Owens. Requesting hugemem nodes allocates entire nodes.
      - **vis** - (*1-28 cores*) Use an Owens node that has an [NVIDIA Tesla P100
        GPU](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) with an X server
        running in the background. This utilizes the GPU for hardware
        accelerated 3D visualization. There are 160 of these nodes on Owens.

      If you want to use use macromodel, glide, ligprep, qikprep, or epik feature in Schrodinger,
      you need to specify it. Licenses are comma separeated in the format '<name>@osc:<# of licenses>'
      like 'glide@osc:1'. More help can be found on our website regarding the changes in the [slurm migration].
